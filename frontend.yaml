    JavaScript 5 is the "old" version of JavaScript as currently supported by browsers (mostly JavaScript 5).
    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript. Good to be used directly on small projects where build tools 
    and transpiling are overhead. We prefer the use of ES2015 and beyond and use Babel for transpiling so more
    modern an powerful JavaScript language features can be used. SXA

  description: >
    The new version of JavaScript with way more powerful language constructs. See http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/ for
    the language specification. Not all browser support the new ES2015 features, so use Babel - https://babeljs.io/ - for transpiling.
    This means that the project requires a build system. https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/ gives nice overview of the new ES2015 features.
    TypeScript (as a better ES2015+ - needs transpiling anyway)
